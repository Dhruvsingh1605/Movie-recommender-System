## Movie Recommender System

A Movie Recommendation System!
Leveraging a content-based model, this machine learning endeavor dives into
the vast world of cinema, suggesting movies based on
their content and characteristics. Utilizing the comprehensive CMDB5000
Movies Dataset from Kaggle, I embarked on a journey to
revolutionize the movie-watching experience.
Armed with powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I meticulously
analyzed and visualized the data, unraveling hidden
patterns and insights.
In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), I employed NLTK to delve
deeper into movie plots, extracting meaningful
features to enhance recommendation accuracy.
